# Quick Setup
1. Download the most latest release from [here](https://github.com/grenade-inspector0/R6-AFK-Bot/releases "Latest Releases Page").
2. Edit your in-game **display** settings to be the following:
   - Set your resolution to 1920x1080 (See "IMPORTANT" section below)
   - Set your game to windowed mode.
   - Set your Menu Display Area to 100
3. Run the compiled .exe, which is called, "R6_AFK_Bot.exe".
   - **NOTE**: You may have to run it twice due to the config being generated on the first run.
4. While the game is running, press F2 and the R6 AFK Bot should start queueing.

# Advanced Setup
1. Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed.
2. Download the [.zip](https://github.com/grenade-inspector0/R6-AFK-Bot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) that has the source code in it.
3. Unzip the .zip file.
4. Open a CMD (Command Prompt Window) in the folder that contains the source code.
5. Run the following two commands: (**IN ORDER** excluding the "")
   - "pip install -r requirements.txt"
   - "python compile.py"
6. Follow steps 2-4 outlined in the Quick Setup section.

# IMPORTANT
1. Widescreen monitors are **NOT** supported. The only way to use a widescreen monitor with my program is to open Nvidia Control Panel and set your resolution to 1920x1080. 
2. Botting bans happen a lot than they used to, so to avoid this do the following:
    - Have a **HIGH** starting k/d ***BEFORE*** you start AFK Botting, this goes for whichever gamemode you decide to bot in. 
    - The goal is to end with a k/d of **AT LEAST** 0.20 in the specific gamemode you decide upon.
3. By default the R6 AFK Bot queues for standard, but you can make it queue any gamemode by  
4. I probably won't provide any support here, but if you need support then join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/banworld "Banworld") and @ grenade_inspector.
